This project involves analyzing job postings data scrapped from LinkedIn. The analysis was conducted in two phases: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights were visualized using Python and an interactive dashboard was created using Power BI.

## Project Workflow

**1. Data Cleaning**
- Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Key Steps:
  - Loaded the raw data from scrapped data.csv.
  - Processed columns such as Level_and_involvement to extract detailed information (e.g., Level and Involvement).
  - Addressed missing values, standardized formats, and ensured data consistency.


**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Tools: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Key Steps:
  - Analyzed job trends, skill demands, and location preferences.
  - Visualized insights like:
    - Job Openings In Each Company
    - Job Openings by State
    - Job Openings at Levels
    - Job Openings for Involvement
    - Job Openings Compared to Total Applicants by Company
- Dataset used: processed_data.xlsx (cleaned data from the previous step).

**3. Dashboard Creation**
- Tool: Power BI
- Key Steps:
  - Designed an interactive dashboard to showcase key metrics and trends.
  - Visualized insights such as job distributions, salary trends, and skill requirements.


## Key Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning to handle raw scrapped data.
- Insightful visualizations for trend analysis and decision-making.
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for dynamic exploration of results.

## Technologies Used
