## Linkedin-JobAnalysis
# Overview
This project involves analyzing job postings data scrapped from LinkedIn. The analysis was conducted in two phases: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights were visualized using Python and an interactive dashboard was created using Power BI.
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
•	Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
•	Key Steps:
o	Loaded the raw data from scrapped data.csv.
o	Processed columns such as Level_and_involvement to extract detailed information (e.g., Level and Involvement).
o	Addressed missing values, standardized formats, and ensured data consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Tools: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•	Key Steps:
o	Analyzed job trends, skill demands, and location preferences.
o	Visualized insights like:
	Job Openings In Each Company
	Job Openings by State
	Job Openings at Levels
	Job Openings for Involvement
	Job Openings Compared to Total Applicants by Company
o	Dataset used: processed_data.xlsx (cleaned data from the previous step).
3. Dashboard Creation
•	Tool: Power BI
•	Key Steps:
o	Designed an interactive dashboard to showcase key metrics and trends.
o	Visualized insights such as job distributions, salary trends, and skill requirements.
Key Features
•	Comprehensive data cleaning to handle raw scrapped data.
•	Insightful visualizations for trend analysis and decision-making.
•	Interactive Power BI dashboard for dynamic exploration of results.
Technologies Used
•	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Visualization: Power BI
